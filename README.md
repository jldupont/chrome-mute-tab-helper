# chrome-mute-tab-helper

Are you tired of annoying pages that load and start playing audio right away ?

By default, when a tab gets loaded with a new domain (one not already tracked by the extension), the audio state will be muted (state: perma-mute).
The user has now the following choices:

* The user can mute/unmute the domain visited in the browser tab through the extension's browser action button
* The user can mute/unmute the tab through the usual tab menu - this action will not affect the state maintained by the extension
